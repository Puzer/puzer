# Hi there, I'm Dmitrii Nikitko 👋

### AI Executive & Principal Engineer
Based in Spain 🇪🇸 | ⛷️ Freeride Skier | 🤖 10+ Years in Data Science

I bridge the gap between **state-of-the-art AI research** and **business value**.
With over a decade of experience, I operate at the intersection of hands-on engineering and strategic leadership. I've built multi-country Data Science competencies, led architecture for enterprise-scale systems, and delivered production GenAI solutions with positive ROI.

### 🔭 Current Focus & Writing

I am getting back to open-source and writing engineering deep-dives.

- **[LIVE]** [**GitHub Repos Recommender**](https://github.com/Puzer/github-repo-embeddings) — A client-side semantic search engine running in the browser (WASM + Metric Learning).
- **[COMING SOON]** **RL in LLMs** — A deep dive into TRL, FunctionGemma, and GRPO. [Watch this repo](https://github.com/Puzer/Finetuning-LLM-agent-using-RL).
- **[CLASSIC]** [**StyleGAN-Encoder**](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder) — One of my earlier contributions that gained traction in the Generative AI community.
