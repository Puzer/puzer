### 🔭 Current Focus & Writing

I am getting back to open-source and writing engineering deep-dives.

- **[LIVE]** [**GitHub Repos Recommender**](https://github.com/Puzer/github-repo-embeddings?tab=readme-ov-file#training-github-repository-embeddings-using-stars) — A client-side semantic search engine running in the browser (WASM + Metric Learning) - demo.
- **[COMING SOON]** [**RL in LLMs**](https://github.com/Puzer/Finetuning-LLM-agent-using-RL) — A deep dive into TRL, FunctionGemma, and GRPO.
- **[CLASSIC]** [**StyleGAN-Encoder**](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder) — One of my earlier contributions that gained traction in the Generative AI community.
